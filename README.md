# 📚 DST Projects

Welcome to **DST Projects**, my main repository for **learning, experimentation, and portfolio building**.  
It contains multiple **frontend projects** built with React, TypeScript, and TailwindCSS — plus links to **external full-stack repositories** where I integrate Node.js and backend services.

This repository serves as a **central hub** that showcases my development journey across different stacks and technologies.

---

## 🎯 Goal

The goal of this repository is to **document and centralize** my progress as a developer —  
from mastering frontend tools and design systems, to building complete full-stack applications in dedicated repositories.

I aim to maintain:
- Clean and scalable codebases  
- Consistent project organization  
- Clear separation between frontend and backend projects
