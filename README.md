It contains multiple **React + TypeScript projects** and other web development experiments â€” each focused on practicing new tools, patterns, or best practices in modern frontend development.

## ðŸŽ¯ Goal

This repository documents my **learning journey** in software development â€” from basic concepts to advanced patterns â€” while showcasing clean, well-structured, and scalable code.

I continuously improve existing projects and add new ones as I explore new technologies.
